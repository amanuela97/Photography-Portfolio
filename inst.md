- I need you to do some animation to make the website look more complete, do not change the existing core style, just add new animation or effects.
- firstly add a nice subtle animation on the navitems text underline when hovered over
- secondly when i navigate to different pages via the navitems, the hero section image takes a while to load so the background is flashed momentarily which looks jarring. fix this by maybe maybe fading the image gently.
- thridly, make sure any other images under (site) folder is faded in gently, Slide up by 10–20px while fading, and blur slightly and sharpen as they appear.
- Lastly, for all the texts under (site), the first time the page is loaded, have text fade in gently as the user scrolls down the page. maybe you can use gsap for this, i have already downloaded it.
